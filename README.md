Sales Forecasting & Vendor Allocation Engine

This project is a complete data-driven solution designed to forecast sales, automate vendor allocation, and optimize resource (e.g., fabric) consumption for production planning. It simulates a real-world production and supply chain decision support system.

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This system provides:

30-day SKU-level sales forecasting using ensemble machine learning models.

Vendor allocation engine that considers real-world constraints like capacity, lead time, and minimum order quantities.

Resource optimization reports to estimate material requirements based on production allocation.
